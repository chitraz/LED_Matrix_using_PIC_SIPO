# LED Matrix using PIC + SIPO
Goal: Driving a 8x8 LED dot matix display using a small PIC microcontroller by leveraging SIPO shift registers.
This repo contains [code](newmain.c), [schematic](LEDM_Schematic_print.pdf) and [documentations](LED_old_Notes.pdf) for this old (but still neat) personal project.
